# SQL Learning and Projects Repository

A comprehensive repository documenting my SQL learning journey, including:

- **Hands-on SQL Projects**: Real-world examples to showcase problem-solving and query optimization skills.
- **Notes and Exercises**: Summaries and practice problems from *SQL for Data Scientists* by Sylvia Moestl Vasilik.
- **Practical Examples**: Queries, database design concepts, and best practices.

This repository is a combination of learning resources and projects aimed at building a strong foundation in SQL and sharing my progress with others.
